["Most of what i try fails, ..."](https://johanneshaushofer.com/cv-bio) says Johannes Haushofer in the opening of his CV of failures, and so should I. It all started with an article by [Melanie I. Stefan](https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7322-467a), and now i've decided to compile my own. As a third year PhD student, I haven't had the chance to fail extensively yet, but i can clearly anticipate this will happen. For this reason, i'm starting to collect, mainly from memory, every time that i've failed accademically. As failures greatly surpass the achievements, I cannot but pause and reflect that truly "`Most of what i try fails`"
